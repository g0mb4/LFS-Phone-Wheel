Live for Speed Phone Wheel v1.1
===============================

What is it:
-----------
 It's a software, that uses the accelerometer of your phone to drive the car. I've made it, and you can donwload and share it for free. Written in C#(MV C# 2010) & Java (Eclipse).
 
Requirements:
------------- 
Phone:
 - Android 2.1+
 - accelerometer
 - WiFi

PC:
 - .net 4.0
 - LAN (Router)
 - LFS (S1 or S2)
 - keyboard & mouse :)
 
Files:
------
LFSPhoneWheel.apk - for Android
LFSPWPC.exe - for PC
README.txt - this file 

Installation:
-------------
Phone:
1, put the '.apk' file on your phone (Ghost Commander, send to mail, etc..)
2, maybe you have to turn on the "run non-play-store apps"
3, just install the app

PC:
1, just copy the '.exe' file to anywhere (e.g.: to your LFS dir)

Run:
----
1, start the 'LFSPWPC.exe' (PC)
2, in the 'IP' section, you can see your local IP address * 
3, start the 'LFS PW' (phone) ** 
4, type the local IP (2)
5, press 'Connect' button ***
6, start 'LFS.exe'

* :
- if you have other network cards [real or virtual], you can see just the IP of the last card, so you have to figure it out manually , e.g. : "Start" button => cmd => ipconfig)
- that you can se: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyy
	x - IP address 
	y - port
  so you need JUST the IP address (x)
  
**:
- if it doesn't start, turn your phone to 'landscape' state (you can see it in the video)

***:
- if you do everything right, in the 'Clinet' section (PC) you should see this: "Client connected.", if you doesn't, exit the 'LFS PW' (back button) (phone), and do step 3

Buttons:
--------
"Connect" - connect to the server
"Mouse" - turn mouse mode on/off
"^" - gas (recommended)
"v" - brake (recommended)
"_" - hand brake (recommended)
"+" - shift up (recommended)
"-" - shift down (recommended)

Settings (LFSPWPC):
-------------------
-Sensitivity : 
 -- min(20) - max sensitivity, min range
